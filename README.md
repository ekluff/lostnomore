# Lostnomore

LostNoMo is a community lost and found message board. On the home page it displays links to posts with post title and author and a button to show a new post form. Upon adding a post, it is also displayed on the home page. Clicking on a post title shows a post detail page that shows the title, body, author, and location of the post, with option to edit the post, delete the post, and add a comment. Upon adding a comment, the comment author and body is displayed in a list below the "add a comment" form.

This web app is built in Ember.js and uses Firebase as its persistent datastore.
